// ========== BLOCK 01: ASK POSEY LIBRARY STATUS LABEL - START ==========

/// Per-document Ask Posey readiness, shown on the library card opposite the
/// reading-time label (Mark's design, 2026-06-18): a small dot + short
/// in-character text so a reader knows, at a glance, how ready Posey is to talk
/// about each book.
///
/// **Dot** (reuses the model-picker's green-dot language the user already
/// knows): the dot color tracks ONE thing — answerability. **Grey** while the
/// book is not yet answerable (importing / embedding / queued / cooling before
/// its first embed completes); **green** the moment Ask Posey can actually
/// answer about it (its leaves are embedded), and it STAYS green through every
/// later phase (deepening, cooling-down) because answering still works. The
/// **text** is independent — it explains the current activity. (Decoupling the
/// two fixed a bug where "Cooling down" forced a grey dot on an already-
/// answerable book, misreading as "not ready"; Mark, 2026-06-18.)
///
/// **Layout:** text leads, dot TRAILS (flush-right), so the eye always lands on
/// one fixed point at the end of the row (Mark, 2026-06-18).
///
/// **States:**
///   - not set up  → grey · "Ask Posey not yet available"
///   - cooling down → grey · "Cooling down" (in-flight doc, device thermally paced)
///   - embedding   → grey · "Reading ahead — N%"
///   - queued      → grey · "Queued #k" (waiting in the embed lane; Pillar 4b)
///   - deepening   → green · "Studying up…" (answerable now; RAPTOR building)
///   - ready       → green · "Ready"
///   - preparing   → grey · "Preparing…"   (imported but not yet indexed)
/// Pillar 4b (2026-06-18) added the precise "Queued #k" position (from the
/// queue's published embed lane) and "Cooling down" (from the thermal governor
/// scoped to the current in-flight doc), both via `IndexingTracker`.
